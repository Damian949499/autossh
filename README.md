cd ssh-bruteforce-suite
```

### 4. Make Scripts Executable
```bash
chmod +x orchestrator.py ssh_bruteforce.py
```

## üìÅ File Structure

```
ssh-bruteforce-suite/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ orchestrator.py      # Main orchestration script
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ssh_bruteforce.py    # SSH brute force engine
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ combo.txt           # Username:password combinations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md           # This file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ goodssh.log         # Successful authentication log (generated)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ zmap_blacklist.txt  # ZMap IP blacklist file (generated by orchestrator.py)
```

## üîß Configuration

### Create Credential File
Create a `combo.txt` file with username:password combinations (one per line):

```
admin:admin
root:root
user:password
admin:password
root:toor
guest:guest
test:test
ubuntu:ubuntu
```

## üöÄ Usage

### Basic Usage
```bash
sudo python3 orchestrator.py
```

### Advanced Usage with Parameters
```bash
sudo python3 orchestrator.py [target_count] [max_threads] [delay_between_cycles] [excluded_range]
```

**Parameters:**
- `target_count`: Number of IPs to scan per cycle (default: 100,000)
- `max_threads`: Maximum concurrent SSH connections (default: 50)
- `delay_between_cycles`: Seconds to wait between cycles (default: 60)
- `excluded_range`: A single IP range in CIDR notation to exclude from ZMap scans (default: "192.168.0.0/16")

### Examples

**Scan 50,000 IPs with 100 threads, 5-minute delays, and exclude 10.0.0.0/8:**
```bash
sudo python3 orchestrator.py 50000 100 300 10.0.0.0/8
```

**Quick test with 1,000 IPs, 10 threads, 30-second delay, and exclude localhost (127.0.0.0/8):**
```bash
sudo python3 orchestrator.py 1000 10 30 127.0.0.0/8
```

### Standalone SSH Brute Force
You can also run the SSH brute force component independently:

```bash
python3 ssh_bruteforce.py
```

This requires a pre-existing `targets.txt` file with IP addresses.

## üìä Output and Logging

### Console Output
The tool provides real-time status updates including:
- ZMap scanning progress and results
- SSH authentication attempts (success/failure)
- Cycle completion statistics
- Error handling and warnings

### Log Files
- **`goodssh.log`**: Contains all successful SSH authentications with timestamps
- **`zmap_results.txt`**: Temporary file containing ZMap scan results (auto-deleted)
- **`targets.txt`**: Temporary file containing target IPs for SSH testing (auto-deleted)
- **`zmap_blacklist.txt`**: Temporary file used by ZMap for IP exclusions (auto-deleted)

### Sample Log Entry
```
[2024-01-15 14:30:25] SUCCESS: 192.168.1.100 - admin:admin
[2024-01-15 14:30:26] SUCCESS: 10.0.0.50 - root:password123
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

### Orchestration Flow
1. **Blacklist Creation**: Creates `zmap_blacklist.txt` with the specified excluded IP range.
2. **ZMap Scanning**: Discovers IPs with SSH port 22 open across all IPv4 space, respecting the blacklist.
3. **Target Preparation**: Saves discovered IPs to `targets.txt`.
4. **SSH Brute Force**: Tests credential combinations against targets.
5. **Logging**: Records successful authentications.
6. **Cleanup**: Removes temporary files (`zmap_results.txt`, `targets.txt`, `zmap_blacklist.txt`).
7. **Repeat**: Waits for specified delay and starts next cycle.

### Technical Details
- Uses ZMap's `--blacklist-file` option for efficient IP range exclusion.
- Implements connection timeouts and error handling for reliability.
- Multi-threaded design for optimal performance.
- Thread-safe logging to prevent data corruption.

## üîí Security Considerations

### Operational Security
- Use VPN or proxy connections when appropriate
- Implement rate limiting to avoid detection
- Monitor network traffic for anomalies
- Use distributed scanning from multiple sources

### Legal Compliance
- Obtain written authorization before testing
- Document all testing activities
- Respect rate limits and system resources
- Follow responsible disclosure practices

## üõ°Ô∏è Defensive Measures

Organizations can protect against these attacks by:
- Implementing strong password policies
- Using key-based authentication instead of passwords
- Enabling fail2ban or similar intrusion prevention systems
- Monitoring SSH logs for suspicious activity
- Using non-standard SSH ports
- Implementing network segmentation

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**ZMap Permission Denied**
```bash
# Ensure you're running with sudo
sudo python3 orchestrator.py
```

**No Targets Found**
- Check internet connectivity
- Verify ZMap installation
- Ensure the `excluded_range` is not too broad or incorrectly specified.
- Try increasing `target_count`.

**SSH Connection Errors**
- Verify target hosts are actually running SSH
- Check firewall rules
- Adjust timeout settings in the code

**High CPU/Memory Usage**
- Reduce thread count
- Increase delays between attempts
- Monitor system resources

## üìà Performance Tuning

### Optimal Thread Counts
- **Low-end systems**: 10-25 threads
- **Mid-range systems**: 25-75 threads
- **High-end systems**: 75-150 threads

### Network Considerations
- Monitor bandwidth usage
- Adjust scan rates based on connection speed
- Consider geographic distribution of targets
